## Update the Proxy Server

By default, the proxy server is set up to point at port 8000, if you need to do so update in `setupProxy.js` where commented.

## Using NPM

`npm run start` or `npm run dev`  to run the development server

`npm run build` to create a build directory

## Using Yarn

`yarn start` or `yarn dev`  to run the development server

`yarn build` to create a build directory

### ⚠️

To prevent the `failed-to-compile` issue for linter errors like `no-unsed-vars`, rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and restart your development server. Note this will only change the behaviour of certain linter errors to now be warnings, and is added just to allow your code to compile in development. These errors should still be fixed and other errors will still result in the code being unable to compile

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Project 4 - KICKS!
Link: https://sei-kicks.netlify.app/

Overview

I chose to build a social media-like app for Nike Air Jordan collections. It was my final project for the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly.

Brief

To build a full-stack web application within 7 days using Python Django for backend and React.js for frontend.

Technologies Used

React.js
Python
Django
REST Framework
Axios
GitHub
CSS
Bulma Sass


Approach taken

I decided to go solo on this final project to test my knowledge and understanding of building a full stack app. I first drew a wireframe and planned what I wanted the app to look like and the functionalities and relationships that I would be needing. Initially, I wanted to make an e-commerce website for Air Jordans collections with the ability to add to basket and checkout items or just like an item (favourites). I struggled with linking the relationships with the basket and checkout so I just decided to make it into a social-media app where users can like or post their own Jordan. I also added basic features like Register and Login, Edit and Delete item an item, and a Search bar filter.

Wins and struggles

Being able to build an entire app using Django REST Framework and Postgresql with just over a week of learning Python is a big win. I was expecting to have a difficult time adapting to a new language because I was just getting used to React from the previous project. Linking relationships between the Users and Jordans was also a win.

I originally wanted to make an e-commerce app but had trouble with the relationships so I decided to make it into a simple social-media app with just liking relationships. I could have planned better with the relationships.

To dos

Add user profile page to see user details and liked items
Link profile to other users (follower/following)
Add a rating and comments section for items
Make it into an e-commerce website and add a basket and checkout page

Takeaway

As a final project at General Assembly, I was really amazed at how much I’ve learnt in just a short amount of time. Although I wasn’t able to achieve what I originally planned, I still managed to create a basic and responsive app and I’m really pleased with the outcome. I learnt a lot from my mistakes and gained a good understanding on DRF and how relationships work.
